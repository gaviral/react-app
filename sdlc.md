# Software Development Life Cycle

# 1. Planning / Requirements Engineering

## 1.1 Requirements Collection

- search box for products
- staff in stores can send personal recommendations to customers
  - select up to 3 items
  - next
  - personal message (note)
  - button(generate a shareable link)
  - next screen: preview card with product thumbnails, note, and "copy link" button

### 1.1.1 Functional Requirements

| Code  | Priority | Requirement                       | Status  |
| ----- | -------- | --------------------------------- | ------- |
| FR-01 | P0       | _(define functional requirement)_ | _(TBD)_ |
| FR-02 | P1       | _(define functional requirement)_ | _(TBD)_ |

### 1.1.2 Non-functional Requirements

| Code   | Priority | Requirement                           | Status  |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- |
| NFR-01 | P0       | _(define non-functional requirement)_ | _(TBD)_ |
| NFR-02 | P2       | _(define non-functional requirement)_ | _(TBD)_ |

# 2. Design

_(Outline high-level architecture, data structures, and approach.)_

# 3. Implementation

_(Describe core functionality and coding priorities.)_

# 4. Testing

_(List manual tests or unit-test stubs for critical paths.)_

# 5. Deployment / Maintenance

_(Note deployment pipeline and long-term maintenance considerations.)_

# 6. Continuous Improvement (Extra-time Tasks)

## 6.1 UI / UX Enhancements

- Polish visual design, accessibility, and interaction flows.
- Implement progressive disclosure and micro-interactions as time permits.

## 6.2 Code & Architecture Refinement

- Refactor toward beneficial design patterns (e.g., MVC, Factory, Strategy).
- Enforce SOLID principles; eliminate code smells.

## 6.3 Best Practices & First-Principles Review

- Re-evaluate decisions using first-principles thinking.
- Update documentation, logging, observability; verify performance budgets.
